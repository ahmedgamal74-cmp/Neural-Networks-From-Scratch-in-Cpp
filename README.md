# Neural Networks in C++

> **A low-level, from-scratch, ongoing implementation of neural network operations and learning algorithms in modern C++**

## üöÄ About This Project

Welcome! This repository is a personal journey and open playground to **implement neural network building blocks from scratch in C++**‚Äîwithout relying on high-level frameworks.

- **Goal:** To deeply understand, document, and optimize the core operations behind modern deep learning systems, all in C++.
- **Approach:** Start with basics (activations, linear layers, MLPs) and incrementally add more advanced ops (convolution, pooling, softmax, optimizers, etc.).
- **Why C++?** For high performance, portability, and to explore what it takes to build ML infrastructure closer to the metal.

> **I will be adding new features and operations almost every day.**  
> Follow the repo to watch the progress and learn step by step!
